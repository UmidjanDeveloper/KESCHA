# Kescha Age Calculator

This is a console application that allows the user to calculate their age and compare it to Kescha's age, who is a fictional character. The user is also prompted to enter their name and answer a confirmation question, and is introduced to Kescha's friends.

## Getting Started

To run the application, simply download the code and open it in a C# integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio. Then, compile and run the code.

## Usage

Upon running the application, the user will be prompted to enter their name and age. They will also be asked if they want to compare their age to Kescha's age. If they answer yes, the application will calculate the age difference and determine whether the user is older, younger, or the same age as Kescha. The user will also be introduced to Kescha's friends.

## Security

This application contains a security feature that requires the user to enter a password to continue. The password is hardcoded into the code and can be changed if necessary.
